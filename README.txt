==================
 What is Arronax?
==================

Arronax is a plugin for Nautilus to create and modify application
starters (.desktop files).

Arronax adds a menu item "Create starter for this file" to the context
menu (that's the menu you get when you right-click a file in the file
manager). If the file is a application starter you get an item "Modify
this starter" instead.

If you have icons on your desktop enabled Arronax adds a menu item
"Create starter" to your desktop's context menu.

 Status

Unsettings is alpha software. So far it seems to work for me but it
may have severe bugs I didn't noticed yet. **Use it at your own risk**.

If you find a bug in Arronax please report it at the bugtracker at
Launchpad so that I can fix it. Thank you.
