 What is Arronax?
================================


=============================
 Where can I get Arronax?
=============================

Arronax is available at http://www.florian-diesch.de/software/arronax/


========
 Status
========

Arronax is Alpha software. It works for me but I expect it to have quite some bugs. The user interface and the file format may change in future version. **Use it at your own risk.**

If you find a bug in Arronax please report it at the `bugtracker at Launchpad <https://bugs.launchpad.net/arronax/+filebug>`_
so that I can fix it. Thank you.

=================
Requirements
=================

Arronax is developed and tested on Ubuntu 11.10 "Oneiric Ocelot" and Ubuntu 12.04 "Precise Pangolin".

Arronax needs the following packages from the software sources:

 * gir1.2-glib-2.0
 * gir1.2-gtk-3.0
 * python-gobject



If you install the .deb package this packages will be automatically
installed if needed.
